Dota Match Prediction predicts if a game was won or lost in the Valve made game Dota 2. Essentially, a user would input several variables from Gold per min, to experience per minute
the python program would then utilize Scikit's supervised learning and logistic regression to figure out if the match was a win or loss. Currently at 96% accuracy.

Originally I wanted to have it predict in real time but unfortunately, Dota 2 does not provide the tools necessary for the program to show the prediction in real time.

I am planning on updating the variables in the future to possibly have it be used for live pro matches for example and see if I can get it to be accurate enough.
