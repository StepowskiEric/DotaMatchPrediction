Might need to just instead take 1 match ID of 5 players on each side then
avg all stats...


how to implement INGAME? see if you can get the match ID and if it updates in real time or not

Each player might skew data

instead of the hero played, add the current heroes win rate that the player picked
possible if items picked could also be win rate with that item & hero..

account id - to be the players win rate overall? then the team can be averaged from all 5 players win rates, possibly even just the last 5 games.


OPTIONAL VARIABLES:
Game Mode - can be players win rate in that game mode. e.g. Trevors win rate in all pick 47%
